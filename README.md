# UpStarMusic

This repo contains some code I built while I was studying the MongoDB course from [Stephen Grider at Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/). It's based on [Stephen's original repo](https://github.com/StephenGrider/UpStarMusic). It also gave me a taste of Electron and React.

You can install the dependencies and run it by using:
```
yarn install && yarn start
```
